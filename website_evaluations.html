                <h3><a href="https://www.nczoo.org">NC Zoo</a></h3>
                <p>North Carolina Zoo in Asheville. Where you can look at their hours, upcoming events, exhibits, and more.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C - Light background with dark words, high contrast image at the beginning of the page. Contrasting colors on different sections to more effectively divide</li>
                    <li>R - Each section of the page uses the same alternating color scheme background, sections take up the same amount of space, similar font-family, symbols/lines, and font-size</li>
                    <li>A - The alignment follows the entire side of the page, aside from the main picture at the top of the page. Also unseen dividing lines follow stright down the entire page</li>
                    <li>P - Working/Open hours right next ticket purchase form, also right next to "Today at the Zoo"</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="http://www.church-of-christ.net">Church of Christ</a></h3>
                <p>Church of Christ, where you can go for bible passages? Maybe?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C - Using a lighter green shade on a tan background makes it a little difficult to read, aswell as having black text on a blue background in a lower button is very hard to read</li>
                    <li>R - They have several quotes from the bible in different spots along their website. They also have very similar looking buttons right next to eachother but as different colors</li>
                    <li>A - The alignment of the page barely exists as it looks like the entire page is centered. The margins are also bigger on the left than on the right</li>
                    <li>P - The quotes that they have are in the center of the page, but still seperated by blocks of misaligned text. One part they got correct was having all of the relevant links at the bottom of the page</li>
                </ul>
