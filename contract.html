            <h2>Josh Lucia - Contract</h2>
            <p>I, Josh C. Lucia agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2023, ITIS3135, Web App
                Design and Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen</p>
            <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world,
                and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            </p>
            <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As
                such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
            <p>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples
                online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn,
                and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and
                never from my classmates.</p>
            <p>Signed: Josh C. Lucia, 06/02/2023 </p>
