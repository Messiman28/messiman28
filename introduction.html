                <li><strong>Personal Background: </strong>Born in Austell, Georgia, but moved out to Raleigh, NC when I
                    was 3, so the only thing from back there that I remember is burying my cat. Since then, the only pet
                    I’ve had was guinea pigs for a couple months. I went over to friend’s houses all the time to play
                    with their dogs.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Background: </strong>As someone fresh to my 20s, I’ve only worked part time
                    jobs and focused on school. I worked for 5 years at a snowcone stand and can whip up some amazing
                    flavor combinations. After leaving because I moved to Charlotte, I applied to an ALDI and now work
                    there on weekends.</li>
                <li><strong>Academic Background: </strong>GED from Apex High School with a few computer science classes
                    under my belt, moved on to Wake Tech Community College in order to get many general education
                    classes out of the way. Finally, I’m in my last year of my Bachelors of Computer Science degree.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Background in this Subject: </strong>Growing up, I was the tech kid in the house who could
                    fix/diagnose most problems. Now that I have programming experience, I have knowledge in the big OOP
                    languages, but not much in web languages.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform: </strong>Windows 10 PC at home, and a Mac M1 laptop for school.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Courses I'm in and Why: </strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>ITCS 4230 – Intro to Game Design</strong>
                            – I like videogames and it sounded like a fun course toward my degree</li>
                        <li><strong>ITIS 3135 - Web Apps Development</strong>
                            – Wanted to try to get some HTML/CSS experience</li>
                        <li><strong>ITCS 4145 – Intelligent Robotics</strong>
                            – Took Mobile Robotics and wanted to try another robotics class</li>
                        <li><strong>ITCS 4156 – Intro to Machine Learning</strong>
                            – Finished my AI class and wanted to delve deeper into it.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item about Yourself: </strong>My entire life has in some way revolved
                    around the fact that my butt is bigger than most.</li>
                <li><strong>I'd also like to Share: </strong>I’m just a silly little guy with a lack of social cue
                    awareness</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Glad you could make it. Come back early and often for updates</p>
